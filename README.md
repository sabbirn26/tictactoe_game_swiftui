- üìä Score tracking across multiple games
- üîÑ Options to play again or restart with reset scores
- üéµ Sound effects for gameplay actions
- üì≥ Haptic feedback for enhanced user experience

- ‚öôÔ∏è Settings screen with developer information
- üíæ MVVM architecture for clean code organization

## Technical Details

### Architecture

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Model**: `TicTacToeModel` contains the game's core data structures and rules
- **View**: `HomeView` and `SettingsView` handle UI representation
- **ViewModel**: `TicTacToeViewModel` manages game state and business logic

### UI Components

- Custom gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Glass-like UI elements using `.ultraThinMaterial`
- Custom button components for reusability
- Responsive grid layout that works across device sizes
- Animated transitions and feedback

### User Experience

The app prioritizes user experience through:
- Immediate visual feedback when making moves
- Sound effects that correspond to game actions
- Haptic feedback to enhance physical interaction
- Clear score tracking and game state information
- Intuitive controls and navigation

## Implementation Highlights

### Game Logic
```swift
private func checkVictory(for player: String) -> Bool {
    let winningCombinations = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], // Horizontal wins
        [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], // Vertical wins
        [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]             // Diagonal wins
    ]
    
    return winningCombinations.contains { combination in
        combination.allSatisfy { model.board[$0] == player }
    }
}
```

### Haptic Feedback
```swift
static func notification(type: UINotificationFeedbackGenerator.FeedbackType) {
    generator.notificationOccurred(type)
}
```

### Sound Management
```swift
func playSound(sound: SoundOption) {
    guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: sound.rawValue, withExtension: ".mp3") else { return }
    
    do {
        player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)
        player?.play()
    } catch let error {
        print("Error playing sound. \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
